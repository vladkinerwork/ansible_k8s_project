# ansible_k8s_project
## Prerequisites:

Before deploying your application on Kubernetes, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

## Infrastructure and Networking:
Set up your custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), security groups, load balancers, and configure routing tables with an internet gateway.

## Kubernetes Cluster: 
You should already have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. Ensure that it includes:

•	Metric Server
•	Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)
•	Ingress Controller
•	Storage Class (e.g., gp2 for AWS)

## Jenkins Master:
Your Jenkins master should be configured with the necessary plugins.
Ensure you have the Slack Notification plugin installed.
Set up your Slack channel to receive notifications from Jenkins.

## Deployment:
Once the prerequisites are in place, you can deploy your application on Kubernetes:

## Deploy Jenkins Agents:
Ensure that your Jenkins agents have an image capable of executing Ansible commands with the Kubernetes module.
You can use the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin for agent provisioning.

## Deployment Playbooks:
Create Ansible playbooks for deploying your application on Kubernetes. These playbooks should use Kubernetes modules to interact with the cluster.

## Services and Ingress:
Define Kubernetes Services to expose your application components within the cluster.
Set up Ingress resources for external access.

## Storage:
Ensure your application's stateful components use the predefined Storage Class (gp2, in this case) for persistent storage.
